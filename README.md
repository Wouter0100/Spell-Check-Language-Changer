Spell Check Language Changer
===========
This Chrome extension automatically updates the chrome-spellchecker language based on the language that has been manually defined by the user on a per-website basis. 
This way you don't have to switch the language manually every time by using the right-click context menu, but instead you use the icon provided by the extension to set the preferred language only once. This is then synchronized and saved on the cloud for usage on multiple Chrome instances across multiple computers
